# Work log

Short, append-only notes intended to preserve continuity across short-lived builder runs.

Guidelines:
- One dated bullet per meaningful action.
- Record failures (CI link, error snippet) and the next concrete step.
- Keep this file small.

- 2026-02-12: Paused; aligned STATUS milestone numbering to ROADMAP (M1–M7). Unpause trigger: explicit request to resume; first work item is M1 SQLite logger scaffold + smoke test.
